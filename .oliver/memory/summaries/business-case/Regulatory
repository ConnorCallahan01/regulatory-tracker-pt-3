## Key Points

- The Regulatory Tracker is an AI-powered application that continuously monitors regulatory changes using Claude AI as a mock agentic backend to automate detection, analysis, and workflow management.
- User journey spans 7 phases: initial dashboard access, scan configuration, backend agent orchestration (7 stages), results review, workflow management with status transitions, knowledge store search/filtering, and documentation export.
- Backend orchestration includes ChangeDetectionService (detects keywords and material changes), LLMService (Claude API integration for relevance/impact analysis), and ArtifactGenerator (creates markdown and Word documents).
- System implements intelligent filtering with confidence scoring (0.0-1.0) and flags items requiring human review if confidence is below 0.7 or explicitly marked by Claude.
- Workflow management allows compliance teams to transition items through Draft → In Review → Verified states, with verified items stored in a searchable knowledge store with export capabilities.

## Entities and Topics

- **ScanOrchestrator**: Backend component coordinating multi-stage scan pipeline with state management and error handling

- **ArtifactGenerator**: Module creating professional markdown and Word document outputs for compliance records
- **Mock Regulatory Sources**: FinCEN CDD Amendment, FinCEN SAR Advisory, OCC Transaction Monitoring Guidance, Federal Reserve AML Procedures
- **Workflow States**: Draft, In Review, Verified (with bidirectional transitions for compliance review)
- **Impact Levels**: Low, Medium, High, Critical (color-coded visual indicators)
- **Knowledge Store**: Searchable archive of verified regulatory items with filtering by impact level, date range, domain, and jurisdiction

## Relevance to Project

This document provides critical business case documentation for the Regulatory Tracker system, detailing the complete user journey and system architecture needed to implement an AI-driven compliance monitoring solution. It serves as a functional specification that aligns user workflows with backend agent orchestration, establishing decision points and data flows essential for project development and stakeholder alignment.
